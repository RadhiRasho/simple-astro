    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <br />

    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>
        I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
        page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>

    <p>
        This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep
        checking back and see how my journey is going!
